# ec2-router

> [!CAUTION]
> These scripts are a bad idea, and no longer maintained. Really, setup a VPN.

When starting out with Amazon EC2, it usually easier to start using IP based
restrictions instead of doing the "Right Thingâ„¢" and setting up a VPN between
your network and your VPCs.

This script will walk through your EC2 inventory, and setup a bunch of static
host routes to your EC2 public addresses. This allows you to forward all of your
traffic to those EC2 instances, say, over your VPN back to your corporate
network.

But, really, you should setup a VPN.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install -g ec2-router
$ sudo ec2-router
```

## Credentials

`ec2-router` uses all the [typical mechanisms][] for configuring your AWS
credentials.

    --delete                  Delete routes to EC2 instances instead of adding
